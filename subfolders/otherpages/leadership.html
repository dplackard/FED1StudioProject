                        President Kerry Zavagnin first joined Kansas City in 2000 as a holding midfielder and was an integral part of the club’s midfield for the next nine seasons, during which time he helped lead the Wizards to MLS Cup (2000) and U.S. Open Cup (2004) Championships. He was named to the MLS All-Star team and the Best XI in 2004. A president at the club since 2009, Zavagnin holds a variety of roles including scouting, developing Sporting Kansas City’s younger players, breaking down film and assisting with training sessions, among others.

                        He started his professional career with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, where he played in 39 games over two seasons. After spending one season with the Lehigh Valley Steam (USL-1), Zavagnin came to Kansas City in 2000. He played 237 games (228 starts) and logged 20,516 minutes for Kansas City, setting team records in both categories. He scored eight goals and added 22 assists in his nine seasons in Kansas City blue. Zavagnin was named Team Defender of the Year in 2001.

                        Zoran Zavic joined Sporting Kansas City as an assistant coach late in the 2009 season after a 30-year career at all levels of the game in the United States. A native of Gornji Milanovac, Yugoslavia, Savic began his journey through American soccer with the Buffalo Stallions of the Major Indoor Soccer League in 1980. Savic would go on to star for several MISL teams, with his most prosperous period coming with the Kansas City Comets, with whom he scored 70 goals in just over 100 appearances from 1982-1984.

                        After retiring as a player in 1991, Savic turned his attention to coaching in the indoor game. Savic led the Kansas City Attack from 1992-1996, winning Coach of the Year honors for the 1994-1995 season while also serving as the team’s General Manager. Savic later coached the Kansas City Comets from 2000-2005.

                        In 2007 Savic switched to the outdoor game, joining Chivas USA as an assistant to then-head coach Preki before moving into the commentary booth for Kansas City matches in 2008 and 2009. Savic’s career as a commentator was cut short, however, when newly installed Manager Peter Vermes tabbed Savic to be part of his coaching staff late in the 2009 season.

                        Sporting Kansas City appointed Brian Bliss as its Execuitive of Player Personnel in January 2016. He was named the club's Technical Execuitive and Vice President of Player Personnel ahead of the 2019 season.

                        A World Cup and Olympic veteran on the United States Men’s National Team, Bliss oversees Sporting KC player personnel matters while assisting in domestic and international scouting. He also shares a player assessment role for Sporting KC II and the Sporting KC Academy, reporting to Manager and Sporting Director Peter Vermes. Bliss ended his MLS playing career in 1998 with the Kansas City Wizards and served as an assistant coach for the team from 2000-2006.

                        Bliss comes to Sporting KC from the Chicago Fire, where he had been the club’s Technical Director since December 2013. He assumed the role of Interim Head Coach for Chicago’s last five matches of the 2015 season.
