                        Manager and Sporting Director Peter Vermes oversees all soccer operations for Sporting Kansas City, including head coaching duties, roster management, scouting and oversight of Sporting Kansas City II and Sporting KC Academy. Vermes took the helm as manager in 2009 and served as the club’s technical director from 2006-2018.

                        Vermes is the longest-tenured head coach in MLS and the fifth-winningest coach in MLS history. During his tenure in Kansas City, he has won four major trophies – the 2012, 2015 and 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cups and the 2013 MLS Cup – and finished atop the conference standings in 2011, 2012 and 2018. He is the first coach in club history to lead Sporting to eight straight postseason appearances, as well as the only person to ever win the MLS Cup as both a player and a coach with the same team.
