                        Our lead instructor, Gerso Fernandes, has been with the team since 2017. Gerso has been playing professional soccer for 10 years, and his most recent stint was with Sporting Kansas City as a left-winger. As a native of Guinea-Bissau in West Africa, Fernandes played more than 150 matches during a six-year stint in Portugal before arriving at Sporting KC in early 2017. He had spent each of the previous five seasons in the Portuguese first division, including the 2016-17 Primeira Liga campaign with Belenenses.

                        Meet our youngest instructor, Gianluca Busio. At 15 years and 89 days, Gianluca Busio became the second-youngest player all-time to sign an MLS contract when he joined Sporting KC in August 2017. Busio earned his club debut at 16 years and nine days old, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2-0 U.S. Open Cup win at Real Salt Lake, before landing his MLS debut against FC Dallas on July 28. In a 1-0 win over the Houston Dynamo on Aug. 4, Busio became the third-youngest player to start a match in league history and the second-youngest to record an assist at 16 years and 68 days, setting up Diego Rubio's goal in the 74th minute. In a 4-1 victory at Vancouver Whitecaps FC on Oct. 17, Busio became the second-youngest goal scorer in MLS history.
